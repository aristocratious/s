Just like your carpet, your area rugs fall victim to embedded dirt and contaminates. Steamatic will inspect your rug to determine whether it can be cleaned onsite in your home or if it should be picked up and cleaned at the {{site.servingcity}} Steamatic facility. We ensure that your area & oriental rugs are carefully treated only by our certified, trained area rug specialists in our unique plant using our powerful yet gentle Steamatic Steam Cleaning Process. It’s powerfully soft on your investment textiles! Your oriental and area rugs are not just art treasures. They are also very valuable investments. That’s why we clean them with so much care and attention to detail.
