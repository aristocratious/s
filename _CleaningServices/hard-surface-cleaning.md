Just like carpet, tile and grout, stone and hardwood flooring can show embedded dirt and traffic patterns that require professional cleaning to remove.

Steamatic offers state-of-the-art equipment and surface appropriate cleaning products for ceramic tiles, quarry tiles, stone, marble, granite, and all types of grouts. Grout in particular can retain residues and is susceptible to permanent staining. Steamatic technicians can not only clean but seal it from staining, allowing for superior cleanings in the future.  This is all available in the {{ site.servingarea}} area.
